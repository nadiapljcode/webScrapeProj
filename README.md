# webScrapeProj
This is my second project related to Data Analytics, where I've tried to scrape Indeed. 
As far as I know, web scraping is used to extract information from websites. Using a webscraper, one makes a request to get the required html file/ neccesary information. Although there are many webscrapers available online, I thought of building one myself.
